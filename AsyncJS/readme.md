During my internship I had to build a Gym Dashboard for the Gym owners/trainers to track the required information about their customers. Rather than following a traditional approach, I tried to work backwards from the customer’s perspective by organising meet-ups with multiple gym trainers and understanding what they need. I got an insight to multiple features that could be added to the dashboard while leaving room for customisation. A user-friendly interface was built to ensure that all the actions are intuitive and suited to the requirements of our users. The features helped in making the gym management more organised and maintainable. I also ensured that a feedback system is developed into the dashboard to get necessary suggestions for new features as well as resolving bugs. The customer’s satisfaction with the project built reflected on the success of my approach

when someone puts a label of no-fiction, they set out to show you reality, but that fucks off their objectivity in the first place, and someone who puts the label of fiction sets out to imitate reality which lets you fantasize over it for ages but never let's let go of your own reality.
